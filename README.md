# Compiler Project
This project contains a compiler for an innovated language mixed between python syntax and java logic. Developed by a group of 4 students whose studying software engineering at Damascus University, this compiler should behave correctly with loops, arithmetic operations, declaring local and global variables, arrays of primitive types, classes, inheritance, and something somewhat similar to polymorphism!
